# American Calendar

This is a conceptualization of how years might be numbered if the United States were to use an system similar to that of the Roman Republic or Imperial Japan. However, unlike those systems, this year numbering does not mention the presidents by name. This done to reflect a system in which the president is not a leader from whom all authority flows, but rather a first citizen who is temporarily responsible for a large amount of national business.

## Notes

The twentieth amendment to the United States Constitution shifted the beginning of the presidential term from March 4th to January 20th. Though this amendment was adopted on January 23rd 1933, the first presidential inauguration to be affected by this change took place on January 20th 1937. Thus, the presidential years typically begin on March 4th in years prior to 1937, and on January 20th thereafter.

Though a public inauguration sometimes takes place on January 21st, the beginning of a presidential term is fixed at January 20th.

Presidencies that ended in assassination are indicated in red.
